# Google Book Search App

This app lets the user search for books using the Google Books API.

This is my first project where I implemented an API request in a React app. Using a single component as a template for each displayed search result showed me how useful and reusable components can be.

In the future, I'd like to add more CSS to make this app easier on the eyes.

Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.
